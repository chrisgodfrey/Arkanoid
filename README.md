## Arkanoid

My second game on the path to gamedev greatness! I've made simple Breakout clones before in other engines, seeing the most success in Construct 2, although that version would frequently crash due to the level creating an exponentially increasing number of balls. Funny to watch, but graphical coding wasn't for me in the end.

I used to love the original Arkanoid as a kid. Played it for hours on end, on my first ever computer, an Amstrad CPC 464 with 32 colours, an 8 bit processor and an integrated tape deck. If this project goes well I might try to recreate another of my favourite games from that time.
